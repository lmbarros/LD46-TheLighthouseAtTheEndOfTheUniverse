# Random Number Generation (RNG)

*Part of [StackedBoxes' GDScript Hodgepodge](https://gitlab.com/stackedboxes/gdscript/)*

More like *random number distributions*, as it actually uses Godot's native [RandomNumberGenerator](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_randomnumbergenerator.html) class to generate the numbers. Anyway, provides a class with handy methods to generate random numbers in various distributions.
